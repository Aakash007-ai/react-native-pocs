react query rules

//always include variable in query key if it has been passed inside query function
it helps in caching

there should be one QueryClient in whole application 
as it contain QueryCache for the lifecycle of application not a new instance on every render

https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/eslint/stable-query-client

so either desscribe  it as
const [queryClient] = React.useClient(()=>{new QueryClient()})
